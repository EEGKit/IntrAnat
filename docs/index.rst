**IntrAnat** is a free database and visualization software for Intracranial Electroencephalographic (iEEG) data
that allows to locate and register intracerebral electrodes for individual cases as well as
for group studies

IntrAnat is for **research purpose only**, not medical usage. It is provided "as is," Inserm
and its collaborators do not assume any liability or responsibility for
its use.

IntrAnat Electrodes is based on Brainvisa 5.0 (older versions can be used with brainvisa 4.6)
(http://brainvisa.info/ ). It uses some of brainvisa's
toolbox such as morphologist
(http://brainvisa.info/web/morphologist.html ) and cortical surface
analysis (http://brainvisa.info/web/cortical_surface.html ).

It's also using ANTs (http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/ ) and SPM
(http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/ ) for multimodality
coregistration and estimation of the deformation field (« patient space »
to « MNI space »).
